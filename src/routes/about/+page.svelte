<h3> Weird- but it makes Scents</h3>
<p>Since the dawn of wax, candles have always found their space. Whether its creating holiday aromas in your home, preparing for a romantic proposal, or even as a last minute motherâ€™s day gifts, the variety of uses is endless...but what about making candles purely for fun? </p>
<p> Our founder Randal Wickman built this company around the core concept of candles meant for lighthearted fun. These arenâ€™t your grandmaâ€™s clean linen or cinnamon, our candles are about experimenting and delighting with something unique. We want to make you do a double take when you light our candles, maybe it takes a whiff or two before you come around to it. In the end, you should experience something *new*. Out with the traditional, and in with the experimental, its the only way we can create new art ðŸ”¥ </p>
